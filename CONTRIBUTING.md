# Contributing to American-Slang-Dataset

Yo, welcome to the **American-Slang-Dataset** crew! We’re building a funky time capsule of 60s–90s American slang to train Semblance AI—my digital twin that’s gonna talk real, from “dig it” to “phat.” This ain’t about the over-scraped 2000s; it’s pre-digital gold, and we need *your* lingo to make it happen. Here’s how to jump in and keep it copacetic!

## How to Contribute
Got some 60s–90s vibes? Here’s the deal:
- **Add Your Lines**: Drop your decade’s slang in the right `raw_lines.txt` file.
- **Suggest Ideas**: Hit up the Issues tab with phrases or themes you dig.
- **No Tech? No Sweat**: Comment below or ping me—I’ll add it for you.

### Step-by-Step
1. **Pick Your Decade**  
   - 60s: Hippie days, Beatnik beats.  
   - 70s: Disco fever, bell-bottom jams.  
   - 80s: Neon dreams, mall rat lingo.  
   - 90s: Grunge vibes, dial-up slang.  
   - Stick to what you lived or heard back then!

2. **Write Some Lines**  
   - Aim for 5–10 sentences or phrases—keep it casual, like you’re chatting with a buddy.  
   - Examples:  
     - *60s*: “Far out, man—this pad’s got good vibes!”  
     - *70s*: “Catch you on the flip side—don’t bogart the snacks!”  
     - *80s*: “That’s totally tubular, dude—gag me if it flops!”  
     - *90s*: “Word up, this gear’s da bomb—don’t hate!”  
   - No names, emails, or modern stuff—pure retro realness.

3. **Add to the Repo**  
   - **Git Savvy?**  
     1. Fork this repo.  
     2. Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/american-slang-dataset.git`.  
     3. Open `/data/[decade]/raw_lines.txt` (e.g., `/data/70s/raw_lines.txt`).  
     4. Append your lines at the end—new line for each.  
     5. Commit: `git commit -m "Added my 70s slang"`  
     6. Push: `git push origin main`  
     7. Pull Request: Submit to the main repo—bam, you’re in!  
   - **No Git?**  
     - Copy your lines, paste ‘em in an Issue with the decade title (e.g., “[70s] My Lines”), and I’ll drop ‘em in.  
     - Or DM me on X/Reddit—I’ll handle it.

4. **Wait for the Magic**  
   - I’ll curate your raw lines into `curated_lines.txt`—fixing typos, cutting junk—then tokenize it for Semblance AI. You’ll see your words shape the AI’s groove!

## Guidelines
- **Keep It Real**: Only 60s–90s slang—nothing post-2000s unless it’s a throwback.  
- **Stay Chill**: No hate, no personal data—just the lingo.  
- **Credit**: Add your nickname (optional) in a comment—I’ll shout you out later!  
- **Volume**: 10k–20k lines total is the dream—every bit helps!
